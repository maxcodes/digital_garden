- While listening to someone you love keep asking them “Is there more?”, until
  there is no more.
- Treating a person to a meal never fails, and is so easy to do. It’s powerful
  with old friends and a great way to make new friends.
- Everyone is shy. Other people are waiting for you to introduce yourself to
  them, they are waiting for you to send them an email, they are waiting for you
to ask them on a date. Go ahead.
- The purpose of a habit is to remove that action from self-negotiation.
- Anything real begins with the [[Fiction]] of what could be.
  - Fiction is a better vehicle for ideas than non-fiction.
- When you get an invitation to do something in the future, ask yourself: would
  you accept this if it was scheduled for tomorrow? Not too many promises will
pass that immediacy filter.
- When someone is nasty, rude, hateful, or mean with you, pretend they have a
  disease. That makes it easier to have empathy toward them which can soften the
conflict.
- Following your bliss is a recipe for paralysis if you don’t know what you are
  passionate about.
- Do not rush foreplay.
- Most people never, ever forget the first person to give them a sizable advance
  on their own self-confidence — there's no greater security in life than being
a serial enabler of wonderful young people.
- Try stuff. Be gentle with yourself and your collaborators, but get serious
  when you think you might be on to something. Force yourself into failure or
success. Find [[Friends]] who do the same, love fully, and when you struggle ask
for help.
- The greatest punishment for being unwilling to rule is being ruled by someone
  worse than oneself.
- Follow your own advice.
- Videogames offer a lot of advice, just like books do. Check out [@VGAdvisor](https://twitter.com/VGAdvisor)
- You get what you tolerate.
- The pursuit of excellence is less profitable than the pursuit of bigness, but
  it can be more satisfying. 
- After ecstacy, the laundry.
- Don't sacrifice happiness for achievement.
- Get familiar with stoicism. See [this
  video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5897dMWJiSM), then read
[Meditations](https://www.amazon.com/Meditations-New-Translation-Marcus-Aurelius/dp/0812968255/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=gregory+hayes&qid=1594068671&s=books&sr=1-1)
  - that translation is important, otherwise the message gets lost in old english,
"thou shalt" etc
- Give words of encouragement to people around you. Very little is needed to
  make a substancial change.
