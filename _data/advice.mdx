- While listening to someone you love keep asking them “Is there more?”, until
  there is no more.
- Treating a person to a meal never fails, and is so easy to do. It’s powerful
  with old friends and a great way to make new friends.
- Everyone is shy. Other people are waiting for you to introduce yourself to
  them, they are waiting for you to send them an email, they are waiting for you
to ask them on a date. Go ahead.
- The purpose of a habit is to remove that action from self-negotiation.
- Anything real begins with the [[Fiction]] of what could be.
  - Fiction is a better vehicle for ideas than non-fiction.
- When you get an invitation to do something in the future, ask yourself: would
  you accept this if it was scheduled for tomorrow? Not too many promises will
pass that immediacy filter.
- When someone is nasty, rude, hateful, or mean with you, pretend they have a
  disease. That makes it easier to have empathy toward them which can soften the
conflict.
- Following your bliss is a recipe for paralysis if you don’t know what you are
  passionate about.
