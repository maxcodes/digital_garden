- I [tweeted](https://twitter.com/maxholzheu/status/1270762662964498433)
  recently about a little experiment I launched, where I get a push notification
on my phone every time someone visits this garden. The reason is very simple: it
sounds fun! It's the same principle behind having a similar setup to alert you
when you land a new sale on your side gig. It's for the pure thrill.
- I don't plan on ever installing heavy-handed analytics on this site. I don't
  care if it grows or if no one sees it. Besides the fact that it makes the site load slower, it is the digital equivalent of having cameras pointing at you in a public park. Just...nah.
- So...what you see on the screenshot in the linked tweet is really all I see as
  well. There's no tracking, no behavior analytics, none of that. I don't think
it's needed here. I much prefer a human conversation.
- <Highlight>Whenever you visit any link, you're "watering" the sprout. You're bringing it
  to my attention. Reminding me to update it if necessary. Thank you for
contributing to the garden by visiting it ðŸ¥°</Highlight>
  - Did I just solve collaboration? Obv this is very low touch for now, but
    feels so much more natural than "comments".
