metaDescription: "My take on analytics"

import Highlight from "../src/components/highlight"

- Every time someone visits any sprout, I get a notification on my phone. It
  looks like this: <div>![push notification](/images/push_notif.png)</div>
- I like it this way. It gives me a raw feeling of what is catching my visitors'
  eyes, and it gives me motivation to keep improving the sprouts.
- Curiously, the experience is very different from having a dashboard to look
  at. It's not the same to get 3 notifications in a row, than to see a "3" in a
Google Analytics dashboard or similar. It doesn't even compare.
- I set it up this way for a few reasons:
  - I want the site to load as fast as possible.
  - I don't want to share any of your personal information with any third party.
  - I don't want to keep a historical record of my analytics. I swipe the
    notification again, and it leaves no trace.
- This means that <Highlight>when you visit a sprout, you're also "watering" it</Highlight>. You're bringing it
  to my attention and reminding me to update it if necessary. Thank you for
that!
  - I'm interested in how to take this idea further. How can we
    build this garden together? If you've got ideas, [I'd love to hear
them](https://twitter.com/maxholzheu) (psst! Message me! I promise I'll respond)
