I have a love-hate relationship with audiobooks. I love that I can consume books
while walking, cooking or doing something else, but I hate that I can't take
notes easily. That's why I'm lately reading mostly novels when on the go.

That said, these are some great listens that have stood out over the years.

Have one of your own? Recommend it to me <Link to="leave-a-message">here</Link>.
Prefer to read the old fashioned way? My recommendations are <Link to="books">here</Link>.

- [The Art of Asking](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Art-of-Asking-Audiobook/B00OQT8AG2) by Amanda Palmer
  - Read by the author, who is great at adding a layer of sentimentality to the
    book, which is already about surrendering to other people and trusting humanity.
- [This is Going to Hurt](https://www.audible.com/pd/This-Is-Going-to-Hurt-Audiobook/B0721L2DCR?qid=1649844509&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=BWA3J0VNEHC6KMH9PKCE)
  by Adam Kay
  - Read by the author, this book had me cackling all the way through. Amazing
    insights into the life of a doctor; the good, the bad, and the gory.
- [Project Hail Mary](https://www.audible.com/pd?asin=B08G9PRS1K&source_code=ASSORAP0511160006) by Andy Weir
  - From the same author as "The Martian", this is a fascinating story. Great
    for audio because you can hear the alien!
    This book explores its nature and how to trigger it. Whenever I feel stuck,
    I seek flow states to help me escape the stuckness (currently: kitesurfing)
