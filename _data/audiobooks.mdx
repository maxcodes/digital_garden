I love audiobooks. It's a great way to consume books while having my eyes or hands busy, like
walking, cooking or doing something else. They also allow you to connect to the content in a very unique way.

As such, I have a special list for books in specifically recommend in audio form. Here are some great listens that have stood out over the years.

- [The Art of Asking](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Art-of-Asking-Audiobook/B00OQT8AG2) by Amanda Palmer
  - Read by the author, who is great at adding a layer of sentimentality to the
    book, which is already about surrendering to other people and trusting humanity.
- [This is Going to Hurt](https://www.audible.com/pd/This-Is-Going-to-Hurt-Audiobook/B0721L2DCR?qid=1649844509&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=BWA3J0VNEHC6KMH9PKCE)
  by Adam Kay
  - Read by the author, this book had me cackling all the way through. Amazing
    insights into the life of a doctor; the good, the bad, and the gory.
- [Project Hail Mary](https://www.audible.com/pd?asin=B08G9PRS1K&source_code=ASSORAP0511160006) by Andy Weir
  - From the same author as "The Martian", this is a fascinating story. Great
    for audio because you can hear the alien!
    This book explores its nature and how to trigger it. Whenever I feel stuck,
    I seek flow states to help me escape the stuckness (currently: kitesurfing)
