metaDescription: "My journey discovering Claude Code and how AI agents are transforming how I build and automate my life"
---

There's something fundamentally different about having an AI agent that can read
and modify files directly on your computer. Not through an API. Not through a
web interface. But right there, in your folders, alongside your code and
personal files.

I've been playing with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) lately, and I'm
convinced we're witnessing the early days of how personal automation will work
in the future.

## The "Aha" Moment

The realization hit me when I started using Claude Code for something mundane:
[cooking](https://github.com/maxcodes/cooking-with-claude/tree/main/examples/christmas-2025).
Over a few hours, my mom and I planned two 4-course meals and a turkey in a
seemingly effortless manner.

I gave the agent access to a folder. It could read my recipes, modify them,
create shopping lists, adjust portions, even remember and save my preferences
and workflows. Add nutritional values to a recipe? Done. Missing a recipe? Here
are three options. Gluten free version? No problemo. This wasn't just a chatbot
helping me cook — this was an assistant that lived in my file system, evolving
with me.

That's when it clicked: **this is what personal automation should feel like.**

## Automating Everything

Once you have an agent with file system access, everything changes. I'm now
building several personal projects entirely differently than before:

- **Prototyping**: I describe what I want, the agent scaffolds it, we iterate in
  real-time
- **Debugging**: Point it at a folder, it reads the context, finds issues,
  suggests fixes
- **Documentation**: It writes docs by actually reading my code, not guessing
- **Refactoring**: It can see the entire codebase structure and maintain
  consistency

The feedback loop is completely different. It's not about generating code
snippets anymore — it's about collaborative development with something that can
see and touch the same files you're working with. Sometimes those files are
code, but it works just as well with plaintext or markdown files.

## Mobile Agents with Happy

One of the first concessions I had to make was that since the agent is not "in
the cloud", I had to be in front of my computer in order to interact with my
agents. But what if I have an idea for a project on the go? I was already
thinking of building a mobile solution but then I found
[Happy](https://github.com/slopus/happy). It's a wrapper of Claude Code that
still runs on my machine, has access to my files and context, but I can interact
with it from my phone. Problem solved!

Imagine being at the store and asking your agent to check what ingredients you
already have at home by reading your inventory file. Or having an idea for a
feature while walking and dictating it to your agent, which immediately opens
the relevant files and starts planning the implementation.

This is the bridge between "computing" and "living" — agents that follow you
throughout your day, not just when you're at a keyboard.

## MCPs: Giving Agents Superpowers

Then there's the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This is where things get wild.

MCPs let you give your agents specific capabilities and skills. Want your agent
to control your smart home? Check your calendar? Query your database? Send
emails? MCPs make it possible.

The pattern I'm seeing emerge:
1. **Context** (file system access + relevant data)
2. **Capabilities** (MCPs that let the agent interact with specific
tools/services)
3. **Access** (natural language interface to orchestrate everything, from
anywhere)

Put those three together, and you have something that starts to feel like a
personal operating system.

## What This Means

I think we're at the beginning of a major shift in how we interact with our
computers.

For years, automation meant:
- Learning scripting languages
- Setting up complex workflows
- Maintaining brittle integrations
- Doing things the computer's way

But with AI agents that understand natural language, can read and write files,
and have access to the right tools through MCPs, automation becomes
conversational.

You describe what you want. The agent figures out how to do it. You iterate
together. It learns your patterns and preferences over time.

This isn't just about writing code faster. It's about delegating entire
categories of tasks to something that can work alongside you, in your
environment, with your context.

## Getting Started

If you're curious about this:

- Try [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) — give it access to a small project
  folder and see what happens
- Check out [Happy](https://github.com/slopus/happy) if you want mobile access
  to your agents
- Explore [AgentSkills](https://agentskills.io/home) to understand how to
  package a workflow into a repeatable process that an agent can execute.
- Start small: automate one annoying task in your life

The future of personal automation isn't about replacing developers or making
humans obsolete. It's about augmenting what we can do, reducing friction, and
letting us focus on the interesting problems while delegating the tedious stuff.

And honestly? It's just fun to have an intelligent assistant living in your
computer, ready to help with whatever you're working on.
