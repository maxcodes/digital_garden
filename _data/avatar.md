- One of the first sprouts that made its way into the garden was an outline of a
  post I wanted to make on the series "Avatar: The Last Airbender".
- I wanted to write it because I had just finished watching the show for the
  first time, and I was absolutely floored. It is probably the best series I've
  ever watched, period. And if you know me, I'm not the kind of person who says that about everything I see. It is truly a work of art, covering hard topics like genocide, gender discrimination, war, and free choice while still remaining a children-friendly show.
  - You know someone understands a topic deeply if they can explain complex
    terms simply.
- As I was preparing and researching what was written already, I became more and
  more invested in it, and allowed the scope of the project to balloon out of
  control. I had a lot of things to say, and I wanted it to be perfect.
- So what happened? After weeks of research, I had an outline. I had the main
  topics I wanted to cover, and I had drawn other examples from other sources to
  paint a better picture.
  - For example: In "The Courage to Be Disliked", the professor says: "people who choose unfree ways to live, when seeing free people, criticise them as hedonistic. This is a lie to help one accept his own unfree life."
  - This is a useful lens through which to see Zuko's narrative arc: He
    despises Avatar Aang because he himself is not free, and can't bear to see
    him roaming around freely. When Zuko finally takes control of his own
    destiny (["who are you, and what do you want?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYkuuu9u3EI&feature=emb_logo)), he joins the group in their fight against Firelord Ozai.
  - Another example: I had just finished reading "Endurance: Shackleton's
    Incredible Voyage" and discovered that the events described in the book were
    the inspiration for the beginning episodes of the show. The parallels are
    obvious in retrospect!
- And yet when the time came to sit down and make it all into a coherent piece,
  the burning motivation was gone. I had satisfied my own curiosity and let the
  novelty of it wear off.
- So, I bit more than I could chew. And I learned the following lessons:

  1. When you feel the motivation to write, write! Use the motivation to sit
     down and type your heart out. It won't last forever!
  1. Keep it small, keep it manageable. A short, solid piece is better than no
     piece at all.

- To close, here are the best tidbits from my research:

  - Mythic resonance. We humans have a way of _knowing_ when something is real.
    Element bending felt real. Why? Because they put real thought into choosing
    which martial arts represented which bending styles.

    - "Waterbending" uses movements influenced by T'ai chi
      and focused on alignment, body structure, breath, and visualization.
    - Hung Gar was the inspiration for practitioners of "earthbending", and
      was chosen for its firmly rooted stances and powerful strikes as a
      representation of the solidity of earth.
    - Northern Shaolin, which uses strong arm and leg movements, was chosen to
      represent "firebending".
    - Ba Gua, which uses dynamic circular movements and quick directional
      changes, was used for "airbending""
    - "These nuances add a layer to the fight scenes: Aang is evasive and
      light on foot, never attacking and always dodging; Katara keeps a pouch
      of water like a fanny pack, which she uses as a whip, ice daggers, or even for
      healing; and Zuko, especially early on, bends fire with evident rage."
      - I lost the source of this citation, but it's pretty spot on.

  - "We chose the word "Avatar" because it is an ancient Hindu word meaning "a
    temporary manifestation of a continuing entity."" - The Directors

  - "the showâ€™s only true villains are those who refuse to engage in empathy and humanity"

- I had so much more, but this will have to suffice for now.
