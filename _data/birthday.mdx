- This is an experiment I ran for my birthday on June 5th. It's a virtual wall.
Anyone could edit it (for 14 days, until the free trial of the service expired)
- Instructions:
  - Feel free to use it to write or draw anything you want. It's 100% anonymous so
if you want stay that way, just don't add your name :).
  - Feel free to leave your name if you so desire, too!
  - Don't vandalize, but feel free to enhance anything you see :)
- Thank you for celebrating my birthday with me :)
