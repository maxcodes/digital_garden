  - Happy birthday! I procrastinated the entire day thinking about how to write
    something that's not the classic "happy birthday". I hope I can make up for
it by writing something substancial and different from the majority of birthday
wishes. You're special to me. Thank you for the connection we've had over the
past few weeks. My wish is that we expand those little moments of connection
into us getting to know each other better. I wish we dropped the guard more
around each other, so that we actually got to talk about stuff instead of just
joking around, fearing to be judged. I've known you all my life, and yet I feel
I barely know you. I want to change that this coming year. On a separate note, I
wanted to be a part of the video that they sent you, but every time I tried to
record, it felt as if what I had to say was only possible via text, so this is
why I'm writing over here. Anyway... You're special :) I hope you had a great
day, welcome to the 20s! I hope we get to play WNRS soon.
