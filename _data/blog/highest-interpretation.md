title: Highest Interpretation
---

- from Deepak Chopra
- Society conditions us to believe in what they already believe (collective consciousness)
- Find a moment or an event, and question your interpretation of it. Try to think of the highest interpretation of the same event you can find.
  - Is it just as true? More true?
- very related to Byron Katie's The Work
