These are a curated set of books I've recommended privately to my friends. They are outstanding.

- [Meditations](https://www.amazon.com/Meditations-New-Translation-Marcus-Aurelius/dp/0812968255) by Marcus Aurelius
  - This is a book I carry with me everywhere I go. It has the best wisdom-to-words ratio of any book I've read.
- [GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach](https://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567/ref=sr_1_1?crid=230J1Q8W5B7PV&dchild=1&keywords=godel+escher+bach&qid=1623107249&s=books&sprefix=Godel+Es%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C216&sr=1-1) by Douglas Hofstadter
  - Nerd book to blow your mind if you can page through 200 pages of deep math.
- [Flow](https://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Experience-Perennial-Classics/dp/0061339202/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3VA3B22XMJCXO&dchild=1&keywords=flow+mihaly+csikszentmihalyi&qid=1623107276&s=books&sprefix=flow+%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C217&sr=1-1) by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi
  - Flow, the state of mind where time flies and you're not aware of yourself.
    This book explores its nature and how to trigger it. Whenever I feel stuck,
    I seek flow states to help me escape the stuckness (currently: kitesurfing)
- [The Art of Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Learning-Journey-Optimal-Performance/dp/0743277465/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1623107423&sr=1-1) by Josh Waitzkin
  - Practical advice on how to go from 90% to 99%. Spoiler: What got you here
    won't get you there.
- [High Output Management](https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management/dp/B08Z8K64S2/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2ZTIFT50BSX79&dchild=1&keywords=high+output+management&qid=1623107463&s=books&sprefix=high+out%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C214&sr=1-1) by Andy Grove
  - THE book on management. A must read if you have direct reports.
- [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](https://www.amazon.com/Hitchhikers-Guide-Galaxy-Douglas-Adams/dp/0345418913/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1623107489&sr=1-1) by Douglas Adams
- [Open](https://www.amazon.com/Open-Autobiography-Andre-Agassi/dp/0307388409) by Andre Agassi
  - The only sports autobiography that's worth reading in my opinion.
