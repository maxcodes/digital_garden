- [The Courage to be Disliked](https://www.amazon.com/Courage-Be-Disliked-Phenomenon-Happiness/dp/1501197274) by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga
  - A book about Adlerian psychology, which is a branch of psychology that
    focuses on the individual's ability to choose their own way.
  - You can only really know you're free if you can make decisions that are
    unpopular. If everything you decide is coincidentally what everyone else
    decides as well, are you really thinking on your own?
- [Meditations](https://www.amazon.com/Meditations-New-Translation-Marcus-Aurelius/dp/0812968255) by Marcus Aurelius
  - This is a book I carry with me everywhere I go. It has the best wisdom-to-words ratio of any book I've read.
- [The Art of Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Learning-Journey-Optimal-Performance/dp/0743277465/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1623107423&sr=1-1) by Josh Waitzkin
  - Practical advice on how to go from 90% to 99%.
  - What got you here won't get you there.
  - Most of the time, being the top 1% shouldn't be your goal. 80/20.
- [High Output Management](https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management/dp/B08Z8K64S2/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2ZTIFT50BSX79&dchild=1&keywords=high+output+management&qid=1623107463&s=books&sprefix=high+out%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C214&sr=1-1) by Andy Grove
  - THE book on management. A must read if you have direct reports.
- [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](https://www.amazon.com/Hitchhikers-Guide-Galaxy-Douglas-Adams/dp/0345418913/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1623107489&sr=1-1) by Douglas Adams
  - An absurd book that's also very funny.
- [Open](https://www.amazon.com/Open-Autobiography-Andre-Agassi/dp/0307388409) by Andre Agassi
  - The only sports autobiography that's worth reading in my opinion.
- [La Casa de los Espíritus](https://www.amazon.com/casa-los-esp%C3%ADritus-CONTEMPORANEA/dp/8483462036) by Isabel Allende
  - What an amazing book. It's so raw, so inspiring, so gut wrenching. Allende
    has the ability to inhabit the mind of every character in the story and
portray their point of view so vividly, that it increases your capacity to
empathize with the "other". This is Latin America with its irreconcilable points
of view, none of them wrong but nonetheless in perpetual conflict with each
other.
- [Gödel, Escher, Bach](https://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567/ref=sr_1_1?crid=230J1Q8W5B7PV&dchild=1&keywords=godel+escher+bach&qid=1623107249&s=books&sprefix=Godel+Es%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C216&sr=1-1) by Douglas Hofstadter
  - Nerd book to blow your mind if you can page through 200 pages of deep math.
