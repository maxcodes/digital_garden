- <Highlight>WARNING: spoilers. ish.</Highlight>
- Summary In a Tweet: A dystopian future in which the masses are controlled by
  means of keeping them entertained and happy. <Highlight>Society is stable and
  happy, at the expense of meaning, high art, science and progress.</Highlight>
- Main Takeaway: <Highlight>Not everyone prefers truth and knowledge over happiness.</Highlight>
- Beauty is attractive, and we don't want people attracted to old things.
  - Why don't you let them see Othello instead?
  - Because it's old. Besides, they couldn't understand it anyway.
  - Why not?
  - Because our world is not the same as Othello's world. You can't make cars without steel, and you can't make tragedies without social instability. The world is stable now. People are
    - are happy
    - get what they want
    - never want what they can't get
    - are well off
    - are safe
    - are never ill
    - are not afraid of death
    - are blissfully ignorant of passion and old age
    - are plagued with no mothers or fathers, children, or lovers to feel strongly about
    - are so conditioned that they practically can't help behaving as they ought to behave.
- Writing when there is nothing to say...
- **Actual happiness always looks pretty squalid in comparison with the overcompensations for misery.**
- Stability isn't nearly as spectacular as instability.
- <Highlight>Being contented has none of the glamour of a good fight against misfortune</Highlight>, none of the picturesqueness of a struggle with temptation, or a fatal overthrow by passion or doubt. <b>Happiness is never grand</b>.
- - Why don't you make everybody an Alpha Double Plus?
  - Because we have no wish to have our throats cut. We believe in happiness and stability. A society of alphas couldn't fail to be unstable and miserably. (Alphas = separate and unrelated individuals of good heredity and conditioned so as to be capable of making a free choice and assuming responsibilities.) **An Alpha-decanted (born), Alpha-conditioned man would go mad if he had to do Epsilon Semi-Moron work** -- go mad, or start smashing things up. Alphas can be completely socialized, but only on condition that you make them do Alpha work. **Only an Epsilon can be expected to make Epsilon sacrifices**, for the good reason that for him they aren't sacrifices; they're the line of least resistance.
- **Each one of us goes through life inside a bottle. But if we happen to be Alphas, our bottles are enormous. We should suffer acutely if we were confined in a narrower space.**
- The optimum population is modelled on the iceberg -- eight-ninths below the water line, and one-ninth above.
  - **And they're happy below the water line?**
  - **Happier than above it.**
  - **In spite of that awful work?**
  - Awful? They don't find it so. On the contrary, <Highlight>they like it. It's light, it's childishly simple.</Highlight> No strain on the mind or the muscles.
- Besides, we have stability to think of. We don't want to change. Every change is a menace to stability. Every discovery in pure science is potentially subversive. Even science must sometimes be treated as a possible enemy.
  - What? We're always saying that science is everything?
  - Yes, but what sort of science? Realize that **all our science is just a cookery book**, with an orthodox theory of cooking that **nobody's allowed to question**, and a list of recipes that mustn't be added to except by special permission from the head cook.
- I like science. But truth's a menace, science is a public danger.
- ... shift emphasis from truth and beauty to comfort and happiness.
- Universal happiness keeps the wheels turning; truth and beauty can't. And, of course, **whenever the masses seized political power, then it was happiness rather than truth or beauty that mattered.**
- **Nobility and heroism are symptoms of political inefficiency**. In a properly organized society like ours, nobody has the opportunity to be noble or heroic.
- Getting rid of everything unpleasant instead of learning to put up with it.
