- TO DO
  - [ ] Create an occlusion component to hide spoilers from Zelda post until
    clicked.
  - [ ] Make it easier for myself to link between pages. A LinkedPage component
    maybe?

===

- DONE
  - [x] The colors of the day/night theme should be more garden-like.
  - [x] The color of the highlight in the day theme is a bit ugly. Change it.
