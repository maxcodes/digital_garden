# What are beliefs?

According to Wikipedia, a belief "is an attitude that something is the case, or
that some proposition about the world is true." It is constructed out of
information and experiences we have, and they are ever, evolving. "Objective
reality exists" is a belief. "What is the best way to govern ourselves?" is
another.

# What is this document?

This is a document that I created while procrastinating on some important work,
and it's heavily influenced by [Buster Benson's Codex
Vitae](https://busterbenson.com/beliefs/). I've been recently inclined towards
documenting my beliefs, and making sure I'm living a life with coherence and
integrity. Hopefully mine one day becomes as comprehensive as Buster's.

"These beliefs are my best guess and articulation of my own beliefs, which were
inherited and molded partly by the environment I’ve lived in, partly by the
people around me, and partly by my own interpretation of life experiences."

# Beliefs by Topic

### Cognitive Biases

- We're susceptible to many cognitive biases and logical fallacies, because our
  brains require them to get any thinking done within our constraints of time
  and energy. 🌎 💪 🐲

### Consciousness

- Free will is like a dog attached to a moving train. It exists, but it isn't
  boundless. 🌎 🤞

### Critical Thinking

- Absolute truth about matters isn't directly accessible to us, but it's
  still possible to get closer to it. Especially in the context of making better
  predictions on limited data. 🌎 💪

- The human brain can't comprehend the universe. 🌎 💪

### Dialogue

- Given the exact same information, people will NOT reliably reach the same
  conclusions. 🌎 💪

### Life and Death

- Death is a process, not an event. You don't "die", you "get deader". 🌎 ✋🤞

### Government

- The ideal form of government changes based on circumstances. In other words,
  there is no ideal that is always better than the rest. ❤ ✋ 💪

### Nature of Reality

- An objective present independent of space doesn't exist. 🌎 💪 🐲

- We evolved from more primitive forms without outside intervention. 🌎 🤞 🐲

### Policy

- Policy is best kept at a minimum, to avoid outlawing unknown unknowns and thus
  preventing progress.

- Marijuana should be legal to grow, sell, buy, carry, and use. ❤ 🤞

- LSD and psilocybin mushrooms should be legal under medical supervision. ✋ 💪

- Health care incentives are wrong. We should pay doctors to keep us healthy,
  instead of paying them to cure us. Accidents and illnesses should not cost
  extra. ✋ 🤞

### Rules to live by

- I should optimize for freedom and future optionality. ❤ 💪
- I should constantly monitor my beliefs to make sure I'm not deceiving myself.
  ❤ 💪
- I should be my word. ❤ 💪
- I should manage my stress, health, and clarity by consistently eating well,
  exercising, and getting enough sleep. ❤ 💪

### Spirituality

- We are not the smartest beings that exist. 🌎 🤞

- We were not created in the way described in any of the major holy texts, if
  you take a literal interpretation. 🌎 💪 🐲

- There is no afterlife, heaven, or hell. 🌎 💪

- There are real phenomena for which the scientific method (with our current
  technology) is not well suited for. 🌎 💪

- Astrology is useful as an idea-generating tumbler machine to which we assign
  meaning, but there are no actual external forces powering it. 🌎 💪

- Angels, demons, and other spirits exist as antropomorphised agents in our
  minds that are useful shortcuts for abstract concepts and states. 🌎 💪

- Affirming that God doesn't exist is just as foolish as affirming that He
  exists. 🌎 💪

- God created the Universe (i.e. setting up the laws of physics and/or initial
  conditions), but has not acted thereafter. 🌎 🤞
  - This is pure Deism. I'm currently considering upgrading my belief in God to
    Imminantism - God created the Universe, the laws that govern it and has
    continued to act within them.
