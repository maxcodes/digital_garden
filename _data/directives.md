- First see [“just tell me what to do”](https://sivers.org/2do) for context.
- This is my attempt at condensing knowledge into directives. Definitely related
  to /advice and /books, but unsure if one will end up replacing another. Anyway,
  let's try it out.

- From Dune
  - Be reliable.
    - from my [newsletter](https://maxholzheu.substack.com/p/max-holzheu-s-newsletter-issue-11-234261):
    - “Such a sure hand does my son have with his people.”
    - When I read it, it moved something within me very deeply, and I was caught
      by surprise. It’s such a simple phrase! Upon examining it, I noticed that
      this resonated a lot with my Personal Values. As a leader, I want to lead with a
      steady hand. This is how I’d want people to talk about me, my work and my past,
      present, and future employees. I want to be seen as reliable and trustworthy.
- From Fall, or Dodge in Hell
  - Think about how success looks like in 20 years, and work backwards.
- From Loving What Is
  - Stop fighting reality.
