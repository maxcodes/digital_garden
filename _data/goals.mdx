- Setting goals is the default way we're taught to operate. Set them, achieve, get a motivation boost, and use it to set even higher goals.
- However, setting goals also has a cost: you're putting your reputation on the line each time. You're committing to an outcome, even if it's just to yourself.
  - If you were not to achieve it, your own "word" takes a hit, because you didn't do what you said you would, so how can you trust yourself anymore?
- Goal setting is thinking in [finite games](https://www.amazon.com/Finite-Infinite-Games-James-Carse/dp/1476731713).
- As an alternative, I've found that not setting goals is very freeing. It allows to pursue each day however you desire. This is instantly gratifying.
- It's also much easier to commit to something just for today, harnessing today's motivation and energy levels, without worrying about whether I'll want to keep it up or not.
- This is especially true for people who don't think "HELL YEAH" when they achieve goals, but rather something closer to "fuckin finally I can cross this off the list"
- The virtuous cycle described above (set goal, achieve, get hype, set more ambitious goals, repeat) doesn't work for us.
