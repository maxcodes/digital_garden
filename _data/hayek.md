metaDescription: "My dog"
---

- My dog got bitten pretty badly about ten days ago.
- It is possible that he will lose a leg
- I didn't feel anger while it happened or immediately after. I just threw
  myself at the attacking pitbull and put my life in danger to save my dog. In
those moments you don't think.
- Ten days later, I still feel a bit disoriented. My dog might lose a leg. I
  feel a lot of things about that but I don't have a grasp on my emotions.
- I haven't been able to get emotional too much, which is completely
  uncharacteristic of me. This is very weird.
  - The only time I get emotional is when I talk to my family. And I dislike
    getting emotional with them for some reason. I don't understand why. I am
avoiding the topic with my family because I don't want to look emotional with
them.
    - This sounds as if I believed that crying makes me less of a man. That
      being emotional is a weak state of mind. I don't consciously believe this,
      but maybe there's something unconscious leading me in that direction?
