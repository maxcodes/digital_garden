title: Highest Interpretation
---

- Society conditions us to believe in what they already believe (collective consciousness). This might not be the most useful belief to you, and may cause you distress.
- Find a moment or an event that causes you to feel anxious, distressed, sad, etc. Question your interpretation of it. If a magnanimous being were to evaluate this in the context of the universe, what is the highest interpretation they will come up with? Don't hold back, just think of the absolute best reason for why this particular event had to happen.
  - Now consider: Is it true? Can you absolutely know that it's not true?
