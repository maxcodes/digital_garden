Note: Lots of people are visiting this sprout, so I feel obliged to excuse
myself for the lack of context offered here. These are _deep_ ideas that can't
really be explained by a simple bullet point and have had a profound effect. But
they are currently punchlines without a story. I hope to get around to
explaining these soon.

- You are in charge of your own education. Stop waiting for people to choose
  you, and choose yourself.
- Money is abundant.
- You can't feel fulfilled if you don't exercise your body.
