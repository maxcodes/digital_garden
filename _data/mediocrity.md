metaDescription: "On being mediocre"
---

- I want to be more mediocre in my life than I have been in the past.
- Hear me out here. It will make sense.
- Well, actually, just read the source, it's easier

  - If you're mediocre, you can just read that one. If you're excellent, read
    the entire blogchain, it's really good but not really necessary.
- Ok. Given you've read the above, I can list the things that actually resonated
  without context:
  - Being mediocre doesn't mean quality is bad.
  - Mediocrity means not going all out, reserving "fat" in case it's needed
    later. Insurance against the future.
  - Mediocrity is playing the infinite game. Not putting your reputation on the
    line each time. Living more freely, more stress-free.
  - Setting goals is playing finite games. They are not worth playing if you're
    not the kind of people who get a massive kick out of achieving your goals.
    - I am not. If I complete a goal I set out for myself, I feel _nothing_. I
      don't pop off. 
      - The only times I pop off is when I'm playing a physical sport, or
        videogames.
- If you are the kind of person who gets off on achieving the goals you set out
  for yourself, giving you fuel to set the next, even more ambitious goal...then
ignore this entire sprout, it's not meant for you. The advice that's out there
works for you. Set goals, achieve them, use motivation to set higher goals,
rinse and repeat. This is for people who don't know why but who tried that
approach and found it lacking.
- Living every day doing whatever the f you want, no apologies, is a
  surprisingly effective strategy. So much so, that you might be inclined to
work on your goals again.
  - This has been my experience. When I used to set goals, I would sometimes
    "perform" (i.e. achieve the planned quota of "things to do so goal is
achieved") and sometimes underperform (fail miserably at "things to do so goal
is achieved"). Now, my only goal is to do nothing. I ALWAYS achieve it, so I
always perform and sometimes overperform by actually doing something that's not
nothing.
  - See, nothing has changed on the outside, but internally I feel much more
    peace.
