## El Salvador for Plan B & Tether Summit

Currently in El Salvador for the [Plan B](https://planb.sv) conference and
Tether's Pioneering Progress Summit. Exploring opportunities around USA₮ and
pitching GTQD (a Guatemalan Quetzal stablecoin concept).

## AI Agents & Automation

I'm super excited and playing with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) and
[Clawdbot](https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot) to automate different parts of
my life. Having an agent directly in a folder on your computer being able to
read and modify files is fantastic. I named my instance "Chiko" — it handles
everything from daily summaries to drafting Basecamp updates to managing
background coding tasks while I sleep.

automation](/automation)._

## Current Projects

**Crypto**

- Exploring how to mine [ORE](https://ore.supply/) more efficiently. Also
  learning how to build bots and monitoring tools for Solana projects.
- Playing around with prediction markets at
  [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com). I believe you can make 30% a year with
minimal risk if you bide your time and make a few smart bets. Plus it's fun :)

## Work

Working on [Recurrente.com](https://recurrente.com), a payments platform based
in Guatemala with the mission to bring economic prosperity to the region.

## Entertainment

**Anime** I'm a late bloomer into anime, currently watching _Dan Da Dan_ and
_Evangelion_.

**Gaming** Loving the game [Blue
Prince](https://www.blueprincegame.com/). I love puzzle games and the
dynamic/pacing of this one in particular has been spectacular

## Life

**Kitesurfing:** Kitesurfing in Atitlán.
