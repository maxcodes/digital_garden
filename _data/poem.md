# Cry Out Your In Your Weakness by Rumi

Cry out in your weakness<br/>
A dragon was pulling a bear into its terrible mouth.<br/>
A courageous man went and rescued the bear.<br/>
There are such helpers in the world, who rush to save<br/>
anyone who cries out. Like Mercy itself,<br/>
they run toward the screaming.<br/>
And they can’t be bought off.<br/>
If you were to ask one of those, “Why did you come<br/>
so quickly?” He or she would say, “Because I heard<br/>
your helplessness.”<br/>
Where lowland is,<br/>
That’s where water goes. All medicine wants<br/>
is pain to cure.<br/>
And don’t just ask for one mercy.<br/>
Let them flood in.<br/>
Give your weakness<br/>
to One Who Helps.<br/>
Crying out loud and weeping are great resources.<br/>
A nursing mother, all she does<br/>
is wait to hear her child.<br/>
Just a little beginning-whimper,<br/>
And she’s there.<br/>
God created the child, that is, your wanting,<br/>
so that it might cry out, so that milk might come.<br/>
