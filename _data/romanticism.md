- How do we know that what we traditionally call "progress" really is progress?
- We landed on the moon. Is that progress? My instinctual reaction is yes! But
  why? I don't know!
  - Because we are one step closer to becoming multiplanetary. But is becoming
    multiplanetary progress? 
- Every problem solved opens up new frontiers, new problems to be solved. Like a
  hydra. How do we know we don't have more problems than in the past? How do we
know we're not continuously entangling ourselves further and further?
