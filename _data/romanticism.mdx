- How do we know that what we traditionally call "progress" really is <Link to="/the_nature_of_progress">progress</Link>?
- We landed on the moon. Is that progress? My instinctual reaction is yes! But
  why? I don't know!
  - Because we are one step closer to becoming multiplanetary. But is becoming
    multiplanetary progress? 
- Every problem solved opens up new frontiers, new problems to be solved. Like a
  hydra. How do we know we don't have more problems than in the past? How do we
know we're not continuously entangling ourselves further and further?
- If you were to subscribe to this notion...I guess you could try to join the
  Amish? Is that a thing?
- Like the Luddite movement, the reaction to ridesharing services such as Uber
  and Lyft is not resistance to innovative technology per se, but something
larger and more complex: an attempt to limit the scope and scale of impact in
order to prevent disruption of a particular way of life.
- “The tools that we believe make our lives easier simultaneously enslave us.”
- “What will be the good of the conquest of leisure and health, if no one remembers how to use them?” - Bertrand Russell
