- I don't like going to the gym. I find keeping track of all the different
  exercises, weights, reps, etc too complicated.
- So I found something that works for me: [Simple and
  Sinister](https://www.strongfirst.com/achieve/sinister/), by Pavel Tsatsouline
- The workout is pretty simple: 100 one-hand swings and 10 get-ups.
  - The 10×10 swings must be completed in 5 minutes by performing 10 swings
    every 30 seconds, followed by 1 minute of rest and 10×1 get-ups performed in
    10 minutes.
  - Total workout time: 15 minutes.
  - Every single day, no excuses.
  - Equipment needed: One kettlebell.
  - The SIMPLE Goal
    - Men: Complete the workout using a 32kg kettlebell
    - Women: Complete the workout using a 24kg kettlebell for swings and 16kg
      kettlebell for get-ups.
  - The SINISTER Goal
    - Men: Complete the workout using a 48kg kettlebell
    - Women: Complete the workout using a 32kg kettlebell for swings and 24kg
      kettlebell for get-ups.
- There's a book if you want the full details and science behind this surprisingly
  simple program. You can get it [here](https://www.amazon.com/Kettlebell-Simple-Sinister-Pavel-Tsatsouline/dp/0989892409).
