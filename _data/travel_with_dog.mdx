      - At the very least, the Health Certificate (issued by a vet) is required.
          - Two copies of the professional card of the vet (c√©dula) are
            required.
          - Always bring a copy of every document
  - To get in:
      - The Health certificate is enough
- Guatemala

          - it takes about a day to issue. Go get it 5 days before.
  - External deworming no more than 15 days before departure
  - When leaving, might need another deworming if trip is longer than a month (this is idiotic but oh well).
    - Check with MAGA (Animal Exportation Agency)
