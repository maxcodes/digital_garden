metaDescription: "Thoughts on Zelda"
---

- Everything I say before it says "SPOILERS START HERE" is spoiler-free. You've
  been warned.
- I just spent 10 days playing Zelda: Breath of the Wild for 9 hours every day.
- The game is CRAZY GOOD. 
- One of my biggest regrets is to not have given Ocarina of Time a chance when I
  was younger. I only had Majora's Mask and never understood it until a few
years ago.
  - I played Ocarina on an emulator a few years back. I got stuck at the spiders
    temple and couldn't beat it. 
- Zelda as a game concept is everything I ever wanted: a combination between
  fighting the baddies in a 3D setting, beautiful story, and challenging
puzzles.
- In BOTW, they doubled down on this. Shrines provide the puzzles, while
  doubling as a way for the game to show you how the mechanics work, outside of
a "tutorial".
  - Tutorials are for chumps.
- And the rest is just majestic open world, as big as Skyrim's. Pretty amazing.

- Here we go.
- I got emotional about 3 times and actually cried twice, right before and after
  the final battle. Holy fuck. The buildup is just insane.
- Electric Keese are so fucking annoying!
- Waterblight Ganon is harder than Calamity Ganon. Fight me.
- The fights to get into the Divine Beasts are SO FUCKING GOOD and UNIQUE! I
  loved them so much.
- Apparently there are 600 Koroks????? Insane.
- I finished the game and apparently only have 22% of the game completed. This
  game is crazy long.
- A bike??? Link in a bike??? loooool
