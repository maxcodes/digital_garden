      A garden is best viewed as compared to the current paradigm of the web:
      the Stream. We live in a world where everything is happening right now,
      where <em>reaction</em> is much more common than <em>action</em>. What I'm
      striving for in this little corner of the web is to contribute content
      that a. evolves over time, and b. is timeless. A personal wikipedia of
      sorts. And by doing so, I hope to show that the process of connecting and
      building and extending the work of others is as human and engaging as the
      conversational Stream.
    </div>
    <div className="primary-content">
      A secondary goal is that Iâ€™d also like to extend an invitiation for others
      to spark conversations with me about anything they find interesting. I'd
      be delighted for a friendship to grow out of any of these sprouts!
