      Why a garden a not a blog? We live in a world where everything is
      happening right now, where <em>reaction</em> is much more common than
      <em>action</em>. What I'm striving for in this little corner of the web is
      to contribute content that a. evolves over time, and b. is timeless. A
      personal wikipedia of sorts. And by doing so, I hope to show that the
      process of connecting and building and extending the work of others is as
      human and engaging as the traditional blog.

    <div className="primary-content">
      A secondary goal is that Iâ€™d also like to extend an invitiation for others
      to spark conversations with me about anything they find interesting. I'd
      be delighted for a friendship to grow out of any of these sprouts!
